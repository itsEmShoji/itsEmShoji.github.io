                                        <em>The Way of the Exploding Fist</em> was one of the first games to include realistic graphics
                                        and movements. Similar to <em>Karate Champ</em>,opponents become incresingly harder to fight after each level.
                                        Scoring is based off of the real life scoring system called <em>shobu nihon kumite</em> which
                                        is used in many traditional styles of karate. Using the joystick, direction keysand a "fire" key,
                                        the player can achieve up to 18 different movements, including jumping & roundhouse kicks.
                                        There are also defensive moves including blocks and somersaults.

                                        Fatal Fury was SNK's first fighting game for the Neo Geo system and served as the inaugural

                                        "King of Fighters" tournament (which became the basis for the later King of Fighters games).
                                        Many of SNK's popular characters made their debut in this game. The most novel aspect of Fatal Fury were

                                        where they have to wait for the CPU opponent to change rows before they can in almost every stage. <br>

                                        Mortal Kombat takes place on a fictional island in Earthrealm, where a tournament is being
                                        held at Shang Tsung's Island, on which seven locations serve as stages in the game.
                                        The fighter that drains the opponent's health bar first wins the round,
                                        and the first to win two rounds wins the match. Mortal Kombat was the first game to introduce
                                        special moves performed only using the joystick. The game also sparked controversy
                                        for depicting extreme violence and gore using realistic graphics, resulting in age-specific content ratings
                                        for games. The game also introduced the fatality move, where a character would be executed as a finishing move.

                                        Made by AM2, a development group within Sega, Virtua Fighter's action takes place in 3D.
                                        The images were created using wireframe and flat-shaded quads. Beyond 3D, it retained the staple of multiple characters,
                                        each with their own distinctive moves. Single player mode allows the player to fight against 8 different characters,
                                        followed by a boss fight. The story of the game falls about half a century after WWII, when the Japanese have developed the
                                        perfect martial art, and the World Fighting Tournament is about to start, where fighters from around the world gather to see
                                        who is the best.

                                        Tekken is similar to many other fighting games where the player fights a series of fighters.
                                        Unlike other games though, Tekken allows the player to control each of their character's limbs independently.
                                        After Tekken was ported to the PlayStation, the game was widely well recieved by critics and became the first
                                        PlayStation game to sell over a million units in the UK and is attributed to the PlayStation console's success.

                                        and was developed as an experiment by Namco to explore the possibilities of a weapon-based fighting game.
                                        It was the first motion capture based video game created by using passive optical system markers. In 1997, the game was ported to

                                        Guilty Gear X is a continutation of Guilty Gear. A four-button game, its instant-kill techniques were weakened and
                                        a survival mode was added to the previous game's three modes. The Dreamcast and PS2 versions have sold over 100,000
                                        copies in Japan; they have been praised for their graphics, controls and characters but criticized for their lack of
                                        replay value. The fight system has a four-main-attack-button configuration: punch, kick, slash and heavy slash.
                                        Players may also launch taunt attacks, with their main objective to reduce the opponent's health to zero in a
                                        predetermined time.[6] To win a fight a player must accumulate two points, with each round won earning a point.
                                        Guilty Gear X has features common in fighting games: combos, aerial attacks and counterattacks.
                                        A new feature is the Roman Cancel, which allows a player to cancel their move and its aftereffects to make other attacks.

                                        Developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the GameCube video game console.
                                        It is the second game in the Super Smash Bros. series, following the 1999 release of the original game.
                                        It was released in Japan and North America in 2001, and in Europe and Australia in 2002.
                                        Melee includes all playable characters from the first game in the series on the Nintendo 64 and also
                                        adds characters from franchises such as Fire Emblem, of which no games had been released outside Japan at the time.
                                        Melee's gameplay system offers an unorthodox approach to the fighting game genre with a counter that measures damage
                                        with increasing percentages, representing the knockback the character will experience, rather than a depleting health bar seen
                                        in most fighting games. It has sold more than 7 million copies as of 2008 and is the GameCube's most popular game.
                                        It is considered to be one of the best video games of all time.

                                    <p id="Meltyp">
                                        In the beginning of August 2001, Shiki Tohno hears of a new series of murders in Misaki Town,
                                        similar to the ones that took place in Tsukihime, in the last weeks of October 1999.
                                        Whilst searching for the murderer he meets Sion Eltnam Atlasia who initiates a fight with him,
                                        attempting to capture him. After the fight she reveals that her reason for trying to capture
                                        him is to get in contact with the "True Ancestor" (referring to Arcueid) so that she may
                                        acquire information on the "cure for vampirism". The story moves through a series of fights.
                                        Depending on the outcome of the fight the story will branch in one of two ways. Ultimately this
                                        corresponds to the ending of the game. Melty Blood makes use of widely used concepts in fighting
                                        games such as cancels (canceling a normal attack with a special attack before its animation ends,
                                        allowing for more complex and damaging combos) chain combos (normal moves that cancel into other normal moves)
                                        and the use of super bars (Magic Circuits). It also introduces Shielding, an advanced defensive technique.
                                        The game has gained a cult following.

                                        They must learn from their prior mistakes and perfect every aspect of their mind, body, and soul -
                                        for there is no room for mistakes in this competition. They are unaware that J6, the organization funding the tournament,
                                        has sinister ulterior motives for the contest and the company's top secret Dural program is already underway.
                                        In the organization's quest for world domination, the scientists at J6 are creating the ultimate fighting machine with human features.
                                        The PlayStation 3 version debuted at #1 on the Japanese charts on February 20 and got to number 7 in the UK sales chart. <br>

                                        The third installment in the Super Smash Bros. series, developed by Sora Ltd. and Game Arts and published
                                        by Nintendo for the Wii video game console. The number of playable characters in Brawl has grown from that in
                                        Super Smash Bros. Melee, although a few characters from Melee were cut in Brawl. Brawl is the first game in
                                        the series to have playable third-party characters. It includes a more extensive single-player mode than its
                                        predecessors, known as the Subspace Emissary (SSE). This mode is a plot-driven, side-scrolling beat 'em up
                                        featuring computer-generated cut scenes and a selection of playable characters. Super Smash Bros. Brawl received
                                        critically positive reviews,[9] with praise for the game's entertainment value, despite issues relating to its content
                                        loading times. The game's musical score, composed through a collaboration by 38 renowned video game composers,
                                        was lauded for its representation of different generations in gaming history.

                                        Despite being a crossover, the game is considered to be the eighth installment in the main Mortal Kombat series,
                                        as evidenced by the naming of the tenth entry by this count: Mortal Kombat X. The game takes place after Raiden,
                                        Earthrealm's god of thunder, and Superman, Metropolis' defender, repel invasions from both their worlds.
                                        An attack by both Raiden and Superman simultaneously in their separate universes causes the merging of the Mortal
                                        Kombat and DC villains, Shao Kahn and Darkseid, resulting in the creation of Dark Kahn, whose mere existence causes the
                                        two universes to begin merging; if allowed to continue, it would result in the destruction of both.
                                        Intertwined within fight matches, which are played in a 3D fighter style, are new gameplay modes,
                                        such as "Free-Fall Kombat" or "Falling Kombat," which are activated automatically after throwing the opponent
                                        to a lower level in the arena.

                                         Due to its extremely violent content, the game was banned in Australia due to the lack of appropriate ratings category,
                                         and South Korea, and it has been reportedly indexed in Germany; the Australian ban was later lifted due to the introduction of an
                                         R18 classification and the game was released with many other R rated games in May 2013. During its release month,
                                         Mortal Kombat sold two million copies between both PlayStation 3 and Xbox versions.[120] Warner Bros.
                                         Interactive Entertainment, publisher of NetherRealm Studios’ Mortal Kombat, reported that Mortal Kombat had sold close to three million
                                         units as of August 2011.

                                         this time adding two males to the roster: Squigly, Big Band, Eliza, Beowulf, and Robo-Fortune. Overall, the game recieved mostly positive reviews.

                                    <h3> <em> Conclusion</em></h3>
                                    <p id="2019p">
                                        I chose to make a webpage that shows a timeline of different fighting games that have come out since the genre emerged
                                        in the late 1970s. After talking about how almost everyone enjoyed playing Street Fighter for class, i thought it would
                                        be interesting to look at how the genre has maintained its popularity. Years before the original Street Fighter was released,
                                        games like Heavyweight Champion are still visually similar to fighting games being released currently. For example,
                                         just by watching the gameplay of Yie Ar Kung Fu (1985) and comparing it to the most popular games in the genre like
                                         Street Fighter (1987) and Mortal Kombat (1992) the games look similar. All three’s scoring are based on a time and a health bar,
                                         and it seems all that the user does is move and punch. It seems like a simple concept, but it has continued to stay a popular
                                        video game genre.
                                        <br> One game i decided to feature was Virtua Fighter, which was the first fighting game with 3D graphics and was easier to
                                        learn how to play compared to other games. Battle Arena Toshinden (1994) was the game that fully brought the genre into 3D,
                                        but Virtua Fighter gained popularity due to its 3 button system. In 1994, Capcom released a movie titled Street Fighter,
                                        after the series, which shows how popular the series had become. Another film based on the franchise was also released in 2009.
                                        In 1997, a film based on the Mortal Kombat series was released as well. Tekken, released in 1995, became one of the games
                                        attributed to the PlayStation’s commercial success, which also shows how impactful fighting games had become.
                                        <br>As the genre progresses into the 1990s and 2000s, there is a rise in crossover games like Capcom vs. Marvel,
                                        SNK vs. Capcom or the Super Smash Bros. Series. Super Smash Bros. Melee, released in 2001, is one of the games i grew up with
                                        on the GameCube, and it is still considered one of the most popular video games of all time. Since the release of
                                        Super Smash Bros. Melee, Nintendo has released a version of Smash for each console they have put out and tournaments are played
                                        all across the world. In December, Nintendo is releasing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, which will have 74 playable characters
                                        ranging from the originals like Mario, to the newly announced Isabelle from the Animal Crossing series.
                                        In 2012, The game Skull Girls was released, which i found incredibly interesting for two reasons.
                                        One was that the game’s development was actually paid for through crowdfunding, since its publisher refused to pay for the development.
                                        The second reason is that all of the eight original playable characters are female. To me, this shows a shift in fighting
                                        games being less focused on the entertainment of males, to having a more all-inclusive audience.
                                        <br>Some of the last few games i included were Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 (2016), Dragon Ball FighterZ (2018)
                                        and the upcoming Kill la Kill the Game: IF (2019). These games show a pattern in the popularity of games based on anime.
                                        These illustrate an interesting shift in games becoming based on other media, rather than becoming other media like the Street
                                        Fighter and Mortal Kombat films released in the 1990s.
                                        <br>Overall, I enjoyed putting this project together and i think it is interesting to see how consistent the genre of fighting
                                        games have changed, but also have remained in popular culture as technology has changed and improved. When Super Smash Bros.
                                        Ultimate is released in a few months, i know i will be playing it, and so will millions of other people across the world.
